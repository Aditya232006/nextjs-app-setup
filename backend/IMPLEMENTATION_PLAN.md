## Database Schema Design

### Core Entities
1. **Residents**: Personal info, medical conditions, room assignments
2. **Beds**: Room management with occupancy status
3. **Staff**: Employee records with role-based permissions
4. **Medications**: Prescription tracking with dosage and frequency
5. **Checkups**: Medical appointments with scheduling and results
6. **Events**: Activities, celebrations, and scheduled programs
7. **Documents**: File management with categorization
8. **Visitors**: Guest tracking with check-in/out logs
9. **Billing**: Financial records and payment tracking

### Relationships
- Resident ↔ Bed (One-to-One)
- Resident ↔ Medications (One-to-Many)
- Resident ↔ Checkups (One-to-Many)
- Resident ↔ Documents (One-to-Many)
- Resident ↔ Visitors (One-to-Many)
- Resident ↔ Billing (One-to-Many)
